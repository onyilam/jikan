        <p class="lead"><strong>Jikan</strong> is an online tool designed to support open review. Peer review for scientific journals is known to be closed and opaque.
            <br><br>
        The lack of transparency means that researchers can’t see which papers were rejected and why. Furthermore, they can’t even see the reviews for the accepted papers at most journals, and they can’t evaluate whether the review process was thorough or fair.
