        <p class="lead">The ability to provide feedback and share insight and other information with your peers or the larger community around research is fundamental.  

          Peer review for scientific journals is known to be opaque. Junior researchers often found the process frustrating. 
        The lack of transparency in academic review means that researchers can’t see which papers 
        were rejected and why. Furthermore, they can’t read the reviews for the accepted papers at most journals, 
        leaving the whole academic review process unaccountable. <strong>Jikan</strong> is an online tool designed to address this issue.
        It allows researchers to shed light on the life of the paper, allowing them to share the progress from the intial ideation to when the paper is published.
