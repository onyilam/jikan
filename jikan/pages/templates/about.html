        <p class="lead"><strong>Jikan</strong> is an online tool designed to support researchers to perform systematic literature reviews.
        The underlying algorithm recommends papers for review to researchers based on the similarity of papers.
            <br><br>

        The database currently hosts over 1 million papers that spans across seven different disciplines.
        In the next iteration of the project, we hope to allow researchers to upload a list of papers,
            and recommend related content to help them better understand the landscape of their field.</p>
