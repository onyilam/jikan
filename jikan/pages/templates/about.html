        <p class="lead"><strong>Jikan</strong> is an online tool designed to support researchers to perform systematic literature reviews.
        The underlying algorithm recommends papers for review to researchers based on the similarity of papers.
            <br><br>

        The database currently hosts over 1 million papers that spans across eight different disciplines. This disciplines are arbitrarily designed
        based on the name of the journals that these papers are published in. In the next iteration of the project, we hope to allow more flexibility
        in the search set. </p>
